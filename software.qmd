My colleague Gerrit J. Meijer and I developed this project to help users to estimate contribution of roots to the shear strength of soil using various models. The documentation is structured to provide a comprehensive guide to using the library, including installation, quickstart, theoretical background, and detailed explanations of the available models. pyrootmemo is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it easy to extend and customize for your specific needs.
