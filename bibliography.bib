  abstract     = {A single triggering event such as strong precipitation, may result in swarms of shallow landslides that cumulatively pose significant risks to population, infrastructure and the environment. There is large scientific and societal interest in hazard maps that display the susceptibility to shallow landslide occurrence while accounting for spatio-temporal variability of triggers and influencing factors. In this study, we implemented a generic and scalable hazard mapping workflow in accordance with the FAIR principles that relies on a Random Forest Classifier. It is a purely data-driven approach which due to its modular implementation allows a flexible adaptation to different areas of interest and integrated data. It’s application results in individualized and reproducible hazard maps. The validation of these maps as well as the underlying workflow is considered as well. The workflow facilitates dynamic hazard maps of varying temporal scope. This temporal dynamic is achieved through the integration of highly volatile features such as precipitation events. In this way, hazard maps can be created depending on the weather forecast. Geohazard potential changes dramatically in response to volatile triggering conditions making their inclusion into the mapping process a natural extension to the established static hazard mapping features. First results of enriching data-driven landslide hazard mapping with temporal data are promising. The resulting temporally dynamic hazard maps offer a wide range of opportunities to improve landslide risk management.}

  abstract    = {Reusability of research data is one of the four FAIR principles. Envisioning future data reuse scenarios early in the data life cycle requires anticipation, since data reuse is often not carried out by the data producers, and reuse scenarios are constantly evolving. Data reuse is especially challenging when the data reuser is active in a different domain than the data producer. The application of data science methods, for instance, poses a growing demand on the (meta-)data information quality. In Earth Sciences, the development of data-driven models or data-integrated predictive simulations often first requires to assemble a homogenous and sanity checked data compilation as training data, which is made up of individually heterogeneous and non-consistent data sets. In order to do that in an efficient way the data sets have to comply with the FAIR paradigms. Here, we share our experience from creating a data compilation from sea ice core data with focus on temperature and salinity measurements. First, we will report on the FAIRness of publicly available sea ice data. The heterogeneous character of the data morphology and metadata availability makes interoperability challenging and reuse laborious. To overcome these deficiencies, we developed a workflow to create data compilations. We will conclude with a descriptive analysis of the sea ice core data compilation.},

  abstract     = {Dispersed space heating alone accounts for 40\% of UK energy use and 20\% of CO2 emissions. Tackling heating and building cooling demands is therefore critical to achieve net zero ambitions in the UK. The most energy efficient way to decarbonise heating and cooling is through the use of ground source heat pumps and district heating technology. However, capital costs are often high, sometimes prohibitively so. To reduce investment costs, it is proposed to use buried infrastructure as sources and stores of thermal energy. Barriers to this innovative approach include lack of knowledge about the actual net amount of recoverable energy, and impacts on the primary function of any buried infrastructure, as well as the need for new investment and governance strategies integrated across the energy and infrastructure sectors. Additional opportunities from thermal utilisation in buried infrastructure include the potential mitigation of damaging biological and/or chemical processes that may occur. This paper presents a first assessment of the scale of the opportunity for thermal energy recovery and storage linked to new and existing buried infrastructure, along with strategic measures to help reduce barriers and start the UK on the journey to achieving of its infrastructure energy potential.},

A range of field testing scenarios (thermal load and cycling) were applied under natural, external ambient conditions. Soil temperature during heat injection was also simulated numerically by solving a transient heat conduction equation with a finite difference modelling scheme. The developed model was validated using measurements from the lysimeter setup which then enabled numerical experiments into the effects of varying hydrological regimes to be performed. Results of the field testing showed that heat injection propagates a temperature change only at deeper layers, while the temperature of shallow layers are still governed by the atmospheric conditions.},

There is evidence in the field that deterioration processes are occurring over the life of an asset, comprising cracking and loss of suction. These are weather-driven processes that occur in the absence of increased mechanical loads and can lead to failure many years after construction. To demonstrate the progressive loss in mechanical performance of clay fill due to a purely environmentally driven deterioration process, a programme of unsaturated triaxial testing was carried out. A new mechanism of soil deterioration driven by cyclic wetting and drying is proposed, based on an extensive laboratory and field experimental programme. The underlying cause for this is the micro-structural changes to the soil fabric leading to loss of suction generation capacity. In addition, cracking leads to changes in hydraulic conductivity and the movement of water into and out of the soil. The implications for slope stability assessment include the need for changeability of soil parameters and of the ground model, with changes occurring both seasonally and gradually over time.},

  abstract     = {Landslides can occur as localized catastrophic deep-seated failures of large magnitude, or as widespread and more frequent shallow landslides. Due to extreme rainfall events, such as the catastrophic one in August 2005 or the most recent one in July 2021 in Central Europe, shallow landslides can occur in large numbers which often severely affect environment and economy while damaging infrastructure and dwellings. Landslide hazard maps allow a predictive assessment at various temporal and spatial scales based on information of past events and additional geo-factors. Utilizing machine learning techniques for this purpose has gained more importance in recent years due to the increased availability of high-resolution and open-source geospatial data as well as open access software frameworks. In this presentation, we will describe our novel approach to machine-learning based prediction of shallow landslides in Alpine regions. More specifically, we propose a decision tree-based machine learning model to investigate mountain slopes for their likelihood of the occurrence of shallow landslide-type slope failures. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework while applying it to Alpine and subalpine areas in Switzerland that are prone to rainfall-induced shallow landslides. A reference training dataset was compiled containing environmental features at sites where landslide events were recorded in the WSL landslide database and at locations where no landslides occurred. The prevailing features at all these locations were extracted solely from openly available geodata either at national or European scale, which can be grouped into topographic, soil, hydrological and land cover features. The deliberate redundancy of the datasets allows us to analyze the relevance and importance of individual input features for the landslide prediction. We pay particular attention to transparency, explainability and reproducibility of our machine learning model by following the paradigms of explainable machine learning such as a comprehensive analysis of the importance of features in the light of the specific application incorporating expert knowledge. Finally, the predictive quality of the machine learning model developed in this study is compared with the prediction based on a physics-based slope stability analysis.},

  abstract     = {\&lt;p\&gt;Several powerful physics-based computational landslide run-out models have been developed and validated throughout the last years. The geohazards community applies these forward models in simulation tools to predict potential landslide run-out outcomes including their uncertainties, and uses inverse approaches to conduct reanalyses and to infer on model parameters for calibration purposes. Yet it remains challenging to turn these computational frameworks into robust, transparent and transferrable simulation-based decision support tools for geohazard mitigation. In particular, the landscape of uncertainties \&amp;\#8211; such as those resulting from the idealised model description itself, input data (e.g., material parameters or topographic data), and numerical scheme related hyperparameters \&amp;\#8211; is still not systematically managed when conducting landslide simulations. Probabilistic hazard maps that take these uncertainties into account imply a large number of model evaluations, which constitutes a computational bottle neck. This issue can be overcome by using High Performance Computing (HPC) resources along with the existing software and resources. Alternatively, physics-informed machine learning strategies use simulation results of the original process model, i.e., the simulator, to train a statistically valid representation, the so-called emulator. Once being trained, the emulator significantly reduces computational costs, while at the same time it grants access to an estimation of the introduced error. A software framework has recently been set up to integrate Gaussian process emulation and the landslide run-out model r.avaflow, an open-source mass flow simulation tool. Emulation-based sensitivity analysis was of comparable quality to conventional studies, and the computational costs were cut significantly. The emulator allowed for the first time to conduct a global sensitivity analyses at every location simultaneously for a complete landslide impact area. A joint effort across different institutes in Europe has been made in this contribution to test the potential and limitation of the emulation techniques by revisiting a number of published case studies. Selection of test cases has been made according to data availability, failure type and computational demand. Preliminary findings suggest that the emulator is capable of reducing the computational effort of modelling various flow-like landslides substantially. Future work will focus on curating a well-defined database of test scenarios across multiple institutes with cases ranging from small to medium-sized debris flows to large rock avalanches.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Although the use of GI has been shown to attenuate flooding, monitored and quantifiable data determining the effectiveness of GI is imperative for supporting widespread adoption of GI within cities and to provide an evidence-base to inform the design and maintenance procedures of such systems and ultimately influence key decision makers .\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The National Green Infrastructure Facility (NGIF) based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, is a purpose-built, publicly accessible, \&amp;\#8216;living laboratory\&amp;\#8217; and demonstration site established in 2017, funded by the UK Collaboratorium for Research on Infrastructure and Cities. The NGIF explores how a wide range of green features such as trees, shrubs and soils can help reduce flooding in cities and make them more resilient and sustainable to future changes in climate and urban pressures. The facility hosts a number of novel GI features of varying scale, monitored with dense sensor networks to allow the in-situ measurement of key hydrological, climatic and biophysical variables (e.g. precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, water depth, runoff and outflow rates) which are able to provide quantified evidence of the hydrological performance of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). Such systems generate detailed insights into how SuDS and nature-based solutions can be used to improve surface water management, optimise geo-energy for building heating/cooling and how systems can be used for urban water treatment.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;GI features across the NGIF include an experimental \&amp;\#160;and fully functional swale, providing protection to the area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in which the feature is located, 10 lysimeter bioretention cells, a series of rain-garden \&amp;\#8216;ensembles\&amp;\#8217; and a monitored green roof system. All experimental features are subjected to prevalent environmental conditions and act as fully functional GI systems, but conditions can also be augmented and simulated to ensure that the GI features act as semi-controlled experimental systems to determine responses outside of the natural instrumented record. All environmental data is recorded at high temporal (\&lt; 5 minutes) and spatial resolution and is publicly accessible in real-time via the NGIF API.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;This presentation provides an overview of the NGIF and discusses the current research activities taking place across the site. Data is presented from each of the GI systems to demonstrate and discuss their performance and responses during natural and simulated events, including extremes, and to assess their effectiveness in responding to localised changes in climate. Future research directions and collaborative opportunities are also highlighted.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of shallow ground heat exchangers is controlled by the thermal conductivity of the soil they are placed in, which is predominantly a function of soil type, mineralogy, density and water content. As such systems are placed at shallow depths where hydrological regime is highly fluctuant due to rainfall and evaporation, it is important to have soil-specific information on how thermal conductivity changes with water content. There are numerous models available in the literature, most of which are not able to define the full range of the thermal conductivity dryout curve (TCDC) with a single equation. This study suggests a modified sigmoid curve to define the TCDC, and introduces yet another statistical model to estimate the fitting parameters of the equation. Validation using data from the literature shows that the model is capable of producing the full range of TCDC for soils with 90\% and less sand content.},

  abstract     = {Space heating and cooling comprises a significant portion of the overall energy consumption. Ground heat exchangers (GHE), are a sustainable alternative to conventional, non-renewably powered heating and cooling systems. Space is a scarce resource in densely urbanised areas, allocating dedicated locations to build GHE systems can result in high initial capital costs and an inflexibility in retrofitting. An alternative solution is to utilise existing, multi-benefit and resilient Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in cities. An investigation into the feasibility of utilising SuDS as sites for potential GHEs requires an understanding of their thermal and hydrological behaviour and boundary conditions. This study utilises a heavily-instrumented, vegetated lysimeter setup, exposed to atmospheric conditions, to test a pilot-scale SuDS heat exchanger. Heat rejection into the substrate of a SuDS has been simulated with the application of heat via voltage-controlled heating cables at a depth of 850 mm for 72-hour durations (at three different power inputs) with 96-hours between each power input. These heat dissipation periods are reflected in measured soil temperature profiles. Volumetric water content, matric suction, soil temperature and heat flux are monitored at various locations in the lysimeter. A finite difference modelling scheme has been developed to simulate the variation in soil temperature due to heat rejection.},

The capacity of such systems for energy storage is strongly dependent on the thermal and hydrological boundary conditions, estimation of their feasibility requires a deep understanding of how atmospheric conditions and the near-surface hydrological regime affect heat transfer. A large-scale, outdoor lysimeter has been set up at the (UK) National Green Infrastructure Facility in order to monitor the influence of atmospheric conditions on hydrological and thermal properties of SuDS. Volumetric water content, matric suction and temperature were monitored at various depths and locations within the sand and topsoil layer. Additionally, thermal conductivity at multiple depths, and heat flux at the surface and bottom boundary were measured. Results of the initial monitoring phase, as well as, preliminary laboratory tests are presented herein and demonstrate the complex interaction between partial saturation and heat transfer.

Quantification of mechanical contribution of roots due to their tensile strength, and relationships of various vegetation parameters and plant-induced suction, as well as shear strength, have been widely studied. Although shear strength is directly related to the volume change characteristics of soil, dilative or contractive behaviour of root-permeated soils has not been of significant interest so far. This study investigates how volume change during shearing is related to the hydrological and mechanical characteristics of vegetated soils relevant to slope stability and shear strength of root-permeated soils under partially saturated conditions. Direct shear tests, on specimens planted with a mixture of species from different plant functional groups, were performed with an Inclinable Large-scale Direct Shear Apparatus (ILDSA). Matric suctions were monitored throughout the test with tensiometers. Vertical and horizontal displacement graphs were plotted to investigate the volume change behaviour. Maximum dilatancy angle was found to be positively correlated with plant-induced suction and net normalised stress, both of which were linked to root biomass and the root:shoot ratio.

  abstract     = {\&lt;p\&gt;The UK Government has a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Because 70\% of heating comes from direct burning of natural gas, this target cannot be achieved without decarbonising the gas network. One of the best routes to decarbonise heating is through use of ground thermal energy storage coupled with ground source heat pump systems. However, heat pump systems retain high investments costs, mainly due to the expense of drilling dedicated ground heat exchangers (GHE) such as deep boreholes. One route to reducing these costs is to use buried infrastructure for simultaneous structural function and ground heat exchange. In the past deep foundations, embedded retaining walls and trial tunnels have all been used as GHE. \&amp;\#160;However, there is increasing interest in extending this approach to other shallow buried infrastructure, such as waste and drinking water distribution networks, and green infrastructure such as sustainable urban drainage and swales.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The UK Collabatorium for Research in Infrastructure and Cities (UKCRIC) is a consortium founded by thirteen universities to provide an integrated research capability with a mission to underpin the renewal, sustainment and improvement of infrastructure and cities in the UK and elsewhere. Under the auspices of UKCRIC, a pump priming project called PLEXUS has been carried out. One of the research challenges of PLEXUS has been to consider how much heating and cooling capacity can be obtained from using civil engineering infrastructure as GHE, and whether there are any risks to original structural function from the GHE operation. \&amp;\#160;The project has included trial experiments for (i) soil element thermo-mechanical and thermo-hydraulic behaviour, (ii) the operation of sustainable urban drainage under heat injection, (iii) heat transfer characteristics of a near full scale water pipe segment, (iv) effects of temperature change on the formation of fats, oils and greases in waste water treatment systems. This paper will present a summary of key findings from the project and identify challenges for implementation of this valuable thermal resource.\&amp;\#160;\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Root-permeated soils, planted with combinations of different species, were tested in an inclinable large-scale direct shear apparatus.

The results suggested that the root biomass, as well as root/shoot ratio, was an indicator of plant-induced suction and shear strength of root-permeated soils tested under laboratory conditions.

Nonetheless, shallow landslides on steep slopes covered with vegetation still occur, often being triggered above the groundwater table, due to loss of suction subsequent to rainfall. Therefore, it is essential to know to what extent vegetation enhances slope stability, and to quantify the contribution of vegetation to the shear strength of soil to determine factors of safety. Results of large-scale direct shear experiments on root-permeated soils and slope geometry from a landslide database were synthesised through an infinite slope analysis under partially saturated conditions to find critical combinations of slope angle and suction stress. Monte Carlo simulations yielded a clear separation of stable and unstable zones, which can be used to define the susceptibility of a slope to near surface failure. This method, based on the simulations, has the potential to be used as a regional early warning system.},

NGIF is a living laboratory, that allows researchers to develop and test new technologies under a range of scales and can monitor how they perform over time. Conventional laboratory experiments on soil and water samples can be performed in the indoor laboratory. While outdoor facilities encompass various sized lysimeters and ensembles, which are coupled with advanced sensing networks. Two examples of ongoing research projects conducted at NGIF related to hydrological, mechanical and thermal behaviour of soil are Priming Laboratory EXperiments on infrastructure and Urban Systems (PLEXUS) and Assessment, Costing and enHancement of long life Long Linear Assets (ACHILLES). Our research within PLEXUS is investigating how meteorological conditions, e.g. rainfall/drought, and vegetation influence the thermal properties of subsoil. A large-scale and heavily instrumented lysimeter is being used at NGIF to establish the hydro-thermal behaviour of soil subjected to a simulated summer heating load. ACHILLES focusses on weather-driven deterioration mechanisms in heterogeneous and cracked soils, and researchers at NGIF will setup a lysimeter to measure crack formation, and to observe the changes of permeability, conductivity and soil water retention properties under various climatic conditions.},
