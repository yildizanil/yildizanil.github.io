I am working as a senior researcher and deputy director of Chair of Methods for Model-Development in Computational Engineering ([MBD](https://www.mbd.rwth-aachen.de)) leading the research group *Engineering Climate Change Response*. My research interests centre around geohazards, but range from soil-plant-atmosphere interactions to shallow landslides. I am conducting research on computational, surrogate and data-driven modelling of gravitional mass flows. I am very interested in reproducible workflows, metadata extraction, data-integrated modelling workflows and executable publications.

If you are interested in collaborations, projects, theses, reach out to me.
