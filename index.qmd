## Abstract

Both Green Infrastructure and Ground Source Heat Exchangers provide opportunities to significantly improve the resilience and sustainability of our built environment. Potential of utilising green infrastructure as a medium for ground heat exchange has been investigated by @Yildiz2022 by conducting heat injection tests in a heavily-instrumented bespoke field setup. In order to upscale these findings to many different green infrastructure components with various ground source heat pump configurations, advanced simulation techniques can be utilised. Multiphysics-Informed Neural Networks (@Wang2023) provide a great opportunity here.
