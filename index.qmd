# Welcome

I am working as a senior researcher and deputy director of Chair of Methods for Model-Development in Computational Engineering (MBD) leading the research group Engineering Climate Change Response. My research interests centre around geohazards, but range from soil-plant-atmosphere interactions to shallow landslides. I am conducting research on computational, surrogate and data-driven modelling of gravitional mass flows. I am very interested in reproducible workflows, metadata extraction, data-integrated modelling workflows and executable publications.
